# pi-approximation

This is a simple project that approximates PI with using random points that are either inside or outside a circle.  
  
The circle is not actually drawn, but a random point is calculated to be inside or outside of the "circle".
Then, the number of points inside the circle is divided by the total number of points.  
  
As the number of points tested increases, you will get closer and closer to PI!
